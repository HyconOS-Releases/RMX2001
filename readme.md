# Announcement!
Dear users of RMX2001,

It is with a heavy heart that we announce the end-of-life for our beloved project. 
We understand that this decision may come as a disappointment to some, but please know that it was not made lightly. We have thoroughly considered all options and have determined that it is in the best interest of the project and its users to move on.
It will no longer be maintained or updated. We encourage users to migrate to alternative solutions.
Thank you again for your support, and we hope that you will continue to support us in our future endeavors.

Sincerely,
SriBalaji
